Abstract: The activities of many primary sectors depend on the weather for production, e.g. farming. The climate is changing rapidly nowadays, which makes the existing weather prediction methods less efficient and more complex to use. We require improved and reliable weather prediction methods. These predictions affect a nation's economy and the lives of people. We are developing a weather analysis and prediction system which can be used in remote areas. This is the main goal of the project. Data analytics and machine learning algorithm linear regression are used to predict the weather i.e, predicting the rainfall. In this project, we are proposing a low-cost and portable solution for weather prediction. Attributes like temperature, wind, sea level, humidity are considered as the data. User will enter current temperature humidity, wind, etc. using this data the model is being trained and a new input data is given for which the model will predict the precipitation value and rainfall (heavy, low, moderate).
